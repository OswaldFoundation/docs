# Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to "remember" your actions or preferences over time. Most browsers support cookies, but users can set their browsers to decline them and can delete them whenever they like.

When we say "cookie", we refer to not only HTTP cookies, but also similar technologies wherein identifying data is stored on a user's computer, like local storage, session storage, Flash-based storage, etc. To comply with the EU cookie law, websites should tell people that they are using cookies, and also give them the option to choose whether to accept or reject cookies before placing them. In the GDPR, websites also need to let users decide between tracking cookies, necessary cookies, social cookies, etc.
