# Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to "remember" your actions or preferences over time. Most browsers support cookies, but users can set their browsers to decline them and can delete them whenever they like.

When we say "cookie", we refer to not only HTTP cookies, but also similar technologies wherein identifying data is stored on a user's computer, like local storage, session storage, Flash-based storage, etc. To comply with the EU cookie law, websites should tell people that they are using cookies, and also give them the option to choose whether to accept or reject cookies before placing them. In the GDPR, websites also need to let users decide between tracking cookies, necessary cookies, social cookies, etc.


## Where Agastya uses cookies

Agastya by Oswald Labs uses cookie for storing preferences (e.g., instructions like "turn dyslexia-friendly mode on when the page is loaded") and to store user information (e.g., geo-location and useragent information.) Agastya always takes your consent and only defaults to the absolutely necessary cookies unless you choose to allow tracking cookies.

**The following data is stored:**

- Your location based on IP address (city, region, country, latitude, longitude, accuracy radius); this is an approximate location based on your IP address and **not** your accurate GPS location
- Your continent (to ensure GDPR compliancy in Europe)
- Your timezone (to make sure we show you the local time if need be)
- Your browser and operating system name (no personal files, just the name and version of your agent so we know what devices our users are using)
- Referrer (which website you came from, only when it's available)

Note that **no** personally identifiable information is ever being stored on our servers, not even your IP address. We only store a one-way hash of your IP address (which means we cannot ever get your IP address, we can only confirm that it's you when you come to the website again.)

Your data is governed by [Oswald Labs' policies](https://oswaldlabs.com/policies/), including our Cookie Policy, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Use.
