# Usage

We strive to ensure that Agastya, our website, and all our services are accessible to people with disabilities. We've invested a significant amount of resources to ensure that our website is made easier to use and more accessible for people with disabilities, with the strong belief that every person has the right to live with dignity, equality, comfort and independence.

## Enabling the plugin

Agastya can be enabled by clicking the accessibility menu icon that appears on the bottom-right corner of a webpage. After triggering the accessibility menu, please wait a moment for the accessibility menu to load in its entirety, because the plugin loads after you've clicked on it.

Alternately, you can also press on the keyboard shortcut <kbd>F</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>, because these are signifier keys with identification ridges.

## Screen reader access

Agastya has been heavily tested on screen readers such as VoiceOver, TalkBack, and JAWS. When you open the plugin by either pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> on the button or pressing <kbd>F</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>, you will head the audio feedback "Loading" to signify that the plugin has started loading. Once the plugin has successfully loaded, the focus will be shifted to inside the window and you can use tab navigation to turn features on and off.

## Modes

Agastya has several features to help you access information and get help, like dyslexia-friendly mode and read aloud. [Learn more about modes](/usage-guidelines/modes.html).

## Disclaimer

Oswald Labs continues its efforts to constantly improve the accessibility of its site and services in the belief that it is our collective moral obligation to allow seamless, accessible and unhindered use also for those of us with disabilities. However, despite our efforts to make all pages using our plugin fully accessible, some content may not have yet been fully adapted to the strictest accessibility standards. This may be a result of not having found or identified the most appropriate technological solution.
