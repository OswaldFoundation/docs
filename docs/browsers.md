title: Browser support

We've tried very hard to make Agastya work for all users. Currently, we support all major browsers and our usage statistics show that over 99% of all users on websites with Agastya come from browsers that support the plugin's features. We also track users whose browsers do not support our features.

## Manual tests

Our team, from time to time, manually tests Agastya extensively to make sure that all our features work for all modern browsers. We have also manually tested Agastya to work on the following older configurations:

- Internet Explorer 10â€“11 on Windows 7, 8, 10
- Safari (iOS 6) on iPhone 4S
- Chrome (Android 4.1) on Galaxy S4

## Supported browsers

All auto-updating versions of modern browsers are supported by Agastya on both mobile and desktop devices.

- Google Chrome
- Apple Safari
- Opera (except Opera Mini on Android)
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

Older browsers are also supported:

- Internet Explorer 10 and above

Even features such as Universal Read Aloud, which delivers high-quality text-to-speech, is supported in these browsers. This is a major breakthrough because convention text-to-speech (Web Speech API) is not supported by many versions of these browsers.

## Conclusion

In general, if you're using a modern web browser (or even the default browser that came with your device), you should be able to use all of Agastya's features with no problem. If you do, however, face any issue, please know that our team is available to help you resolve it. You can find out more by [contacting us](https://oswaldlabs.com/contact).
